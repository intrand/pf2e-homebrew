# About

"Project0" is a new region for players to explore. Perhaps there's more than simple legends and myths in these lands. Learn what the locals know. Set out on your quest. Become a hero or the villain!

GM: Start in the [Table of Contents](toc.md) and the [Adventure Guide](ag.md).

Players: Check out the [Adventure Guide](ag.md) first. Then, work with your GM to establish your character in the world.

Important notes:

* This is intended to be somewhere between a one-shot and an adventure - think of how a "mini-series" is longer than a movie, but shorter than a TV show series.

* Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress.

* It's also my first attempt at creating a homebrew world for a TTRPG :) *Be gentle.*
